This is a docker-compose container that can be used to rollout a database that
can be connected to from your your local machine.

To run `docker-compose up`

To run commands on the database edit `main.py` or `main.js`, install the
appropriate libraries, and then run either file.

- you need to install pymongo for python to use the python file
- you need to install mongodb with npm to use the node.js
